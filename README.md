# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using various sentiment analysis techniques. Leveraging a dataset of 50,000 reviews, the analysis involves comprehensive data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization, and experimentation with multiple machine learning models. The highlight is the implementation of a CNN-LSTM hybrid model that demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 90%.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
- Exploration of 11 different machine learning models.
- Detailed analysis and comparison of model performances.
- Implementation of a CNN-LSTM hybrid model showcasing the effectiveness of deep learning in NLP.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis or apply the models to new data, follow the notebooks provided in the repository.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 50,000 IMDB movie reviews, evenly split between positive and negative sentiments. It's publicly available and was prepared by Stanford University's AI Lab.

## Results
The CNN-LSTM hybrid model achieved the highest accuracy at 90%, outperforming other models. Detailed performance metrics and analysis are provided for each model tested.

## Future Work
Further improvements could explore transformer-based models like BERT and GPT, ensemble methods, and application to other domains or languages.
